This project is my first project which I have created from scratch with no guidance either by a tutorial or as part of a course. I have used React (class-based components) and Redux for state management, Node and Express on the back-end with nosql MongoDB as a database. I used sketch to prototype the design, build the logo and also create the photo montages.  I use JWT tokens to authenticate users and protect routes.

I have provided a link to a video I created which showcases the main design and functionality for the site if time is short for the viewer
